# HTML Learning & Practice

This repository is my personal workspace for practicing **HTML and basic CSS** fundamentals.
It’s focused on learning by doing—writing code from scratch, experimenting, breaking things,
and understanding how web pages are structured.

## Repository structure

Each folder represents a different learning track or practice project.

### 📁 First-HTML_Project
My earliest hands-on HTML project.
Focuses on:
- Basic HTML structure
- Linking pages
- Images and file paths
- Simple CSS styling

### 📁 FreeCodeCamp_learning
Practice files created while following FreeCodeCamp HTML lessons.
Used to reinforce:
- HTML5 semantics
- Forms and inputs
- Page layout fundamentals
- Writing clean, readable markup

### 📁 HTML_Project
A larger practice project that was originally its own repository.
I’ve moved it here to keep all HTML learning and experiments in one place.

This folder reflects:
- Applied HTML concepts
- Incremental improvement
- Learning through iteration rather than polished production code

## Purpose of this repository

This is a **learning-focused repository**, not a showcase portfolio.

I use it to:
- Practice core HTML/CSS concepts
- Experiment freely without worrying about perfection
- Build strong fundamentals before moving to more advanced front-end work

Some files are intentionally simple to reinforce the basics.

## Notes

- Code may change as my understanding improves
- Folder structure may evolve over time
- Projects here prioritize learning over visual polish
