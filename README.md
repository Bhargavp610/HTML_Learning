# HTML Learning & Practice

This repository is a personal workspace where I practice and experiment with **HTML and basic CSS** concepts.  
It’s focused on building a strong foundation by writing code from scratch, testing ideas, and understanding how web pages are structured.

---

## What this repository contains

- Basic HTML page structure
- Semantic HTML elements
- Linking pages together
- Working with images and folders
- Simple styling with CSS
- Small practice projects and exercises

Each folder represents a separate practice attempt or mini project.

---

## Purpose

The goal of this repository is learning through repetition and hands-on practice.  
Instead of copying full projects, I use this space to:
- Try things out
- Break and fix layouts
- Understand how HTML and CSS actually behave in the browser

This repo may look simple, but it reflects steady progress and fundamentals-first learning.

---

## Current focus

- HTML5 structure and semantics  
- Page layout and organization  
- File paths and assets (images, CSS)  
- Clean, readable markup  

---

## Notes

- This is a **learning repository**, not a polished production project.
- Code may evolve as concepts improve.
- Some files are intentionally basic to reinforce fundamentals.
